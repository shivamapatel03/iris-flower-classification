# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification â€“ GTU-Microsoft Internship Project

**Name:** Shivam Patel  
**Internship:** GTUâ€“Microsoft Internship  
**Project Type:** Machine Learning  
**Model Used:** Logistic Regression  
**Dataset:** Iris Dataset (from `sklearn.datasets`)  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica** based on the length and width of their sepals and petals.

It is completed as part of the **GTUâ€“Microsoft Internship** program, focusing on applying practical machine learning concepts to real-world classification problems using Python and scikit-learn.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Explore and visualize the Iris dataset.
- Build a predictive classification model using Logistic Regression.
- Evaluate and visualize the model's performance.
- Make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Optionally experiment with other models like SVM, KNN, and Random Forest.
